# CareerPageScraper
ill make this public, but im just making a quick tool to push notifications to me about the career opportunities on the Brown Forman website

I forgot to push this, but since i am putting the link on the website it needs to have a full project in it.

The intended use for this code is to be run on a cron schedule, and text me every day with the current jobs in my local area
